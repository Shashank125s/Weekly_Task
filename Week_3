Week 3 ‚Äì Paging & Sorting in Spring Boot
My Week 3 of Learning Spring Boot

This week, I focused on implementing Paging and Sorting using Pageable and Sort in Spring Boot with Spring Data JPA. The goal was to efficiently retrieve and display large datasets in a structured and performant way.

üìå Key Takeaways
1. Paging & Sorting in Spring Boot
Spring Boot, via Spring Data JPA, provides first-class support for pagination and sorting through the Pageable and Sort interfaces. These features help manage large datasets more effectively and improve overall application performance.

2. Pagination with Pageable
I used the PageRequest.of(page, size) method to implement pagination. This allowed fetching limited data per request, reducing load on the database and enhancing responsiveness in applications that handle large data volumes.

3. Sorting with Sort
The Sort class allows dynamic sorting of records. By using:

java
Copy
Edit
Sort.by("fieldName").ascending()
Sort.by("fieldName").descending()
I was able to implement flexible and user-defined sorting behavior.

‚öôÔ∏è Challenges and Solutions
Handling Large Datasets
Initially, retrieving all records at once caused performance issues. Pagination using Pageable resolved this by limiting the data fetched per request.

Combining Paging and Sorting
I implemented combined functionality using:

java
Copy
Edit
Pageable pageable = PageRequest.of(page, size, Sort.by("field").descending());
This enabled users to retrieve structured, sorted data efficiently.

üí° Practical Application
Paging and sorting are crucial for building scalable, user-friendly, and high-performance applications. These features not only improve the user experience but also optimize resource usage on the server and database side.

üìà What‚Äôs Next
Next, I plan to:

Integrate pagination and sorting with Spring Boot REST APIs

Apply these concepts in a real-world application scenario
