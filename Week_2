Week 2 ‚Äì Logging & Hibernate in Spring Boot
My Week 2 of Learning Spring Boot

This week‚Äôs focus was on Spring Boot Logging and JPA with Hibernate. The goal was to understand how to configure logging in a Spring Boot application and use JPA with Hibernate for effective data persistence.

üîç Key Takeaways
1. Logging in Spring Boot
Spring Boot uses SLF4J with Logback as the default logging framework. Logs can be customized using application.properties or logback.xml. I explored different logging levels like DEBUG, INFO, WARN, and ERROR to manage the verbosity of logs based on the environment.

2. JPA & Hibernate Integration
With the help of spring-boot-starter-data-jpa, Spring Boot integrates JPA with Hibernate seamlessly. This abstraction simplifies working with relational databases and supports basic CRUD operations with minimal setup.

‚öôÔ∏è Challenges and Solutions
Logging SQL Queries
To monitor SQL queries executed by Hibernate, I enabled SQL logging with:

properties
Copy
Edit
logging.level.org.hibernate.SQL=DEBUG
This helped in identifying inefficient queries and optimizing interactions with the database.

Eager vs. Lazy Loading
Initially encountered performance bottlenecks due to Eager loading. Switching to Lazy loading improved performance, and I also utilized @Transactional annotations to manage session scope for lazy-loaded data access.

üí° Practical Application
Logging is essential for debugging and monitoring in production-grade applications.

JPA with Hibernate makes data access easier, scalable, and more maintainable.

Fine-tuning entity loading strategies directly impacts application performance.

üìå What‚Äôs Next
In the upcoming week, I plan to:

Build RESTful APIs with Spring Boot

Explore advanced Hibernate features like caching, criteria queries, and custom repositories
